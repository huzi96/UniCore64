config EARLY_PRINTK
	def_bool DEBUG_OCD
	depends on PRINTK
	help
	  Write kernel log output directly into the ocd or to a serial port.

	  This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very
	  early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation
	  it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate
	  with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,
	  unless you want to debug such a crash.

config OCD_CONSOLE

	depends on VGA_CONSOLE!=y && FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE!=y && DEBUG_OCD
	default y

config DEBUG_REDZONE
	bool "Protect stack when red zone enabled"
	default n
	help
	  In common sense, compiler and os should guarantee stack discipline.

	  However, we need to consider an optimization method named red zone,
	  which will use unallocated stack space as temperary storage area.
	  Since interrupts could take place in priviledge mode, we need to
	  reserve additional stack space for correctness.
