 * This version of ioremap ensures that the memory is marked uncachable
 * on the CPU as well as honouring existing caching rules from things like
 * the PCI bus. Note that there are other caches and buffers on many
 * busses. In particular driver authors should read up on PCI writes
 *
 * It's useful if some control registers are in such an area and
 * write combining or read caching is not desirable:

 * Must be freed with iounmap.
